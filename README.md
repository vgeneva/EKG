# EKG
Processing EKG data

For record[0], one can see that this patient has MLII and V5 leads only. There are usually 12 leads on the body when recording the ECG. 

The 12-lead ECG is the standard for a comprehensive view of the heart's electrical activity. It combines three limb leads (I, II, III), three augmented limb leads (aVR, aVL, aVF), and six precordial leads (V1-V6), providing a 360-degree view of the heart.

Each ECG lead provides a view of the heartâ€™s electrical activity from a different angle or perspective. The electrical impulses of the heart are recorded by electrodes placed on the body, and the configuration of these electrodes defines the lead. Each lead captures a unique projection of the heart's electrical signal, giving cardiologists insight into different aspects of heart function.

Lead II (MLII): Provides the clearest and most stable signal for continuous monitoring, often used in telemetry and during surgeries.

Precordial Leads (V1-V6): Essential for diagnosing acute coronary syndromes, including anterior and lateral wall infarctions.


record[0] has these 2 leads:

Lead II (MLII) records the difference in electrical potential between the right arm (negative electrode) and the left leg (positive electrode). It is commonly used because it provides a clear view of the heart's electrical axis, particularly the P waves and QRS complex.


Lead V5 is part of the precordial (chest) leads and is placed on the left side of the chest. It provides a horizontal view of the heart, focusing on the lateral aspect of the left ventricle.
